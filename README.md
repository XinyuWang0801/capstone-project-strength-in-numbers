This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

NPM (node package manager) is required to install external dependencies for this project. You can download it at:
https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

In terms of git management please refer to the git section.

Once you have cloned the project into your remote you will need to install all the required packages in order to start the application:
```
npm install
```

Linting has also been setup in this project to ensure consistent code practices. If you are using VSCode you can install the ESLint extension so you can see the linting errors in the editor - will warn you of potential problems as you write code rather then have to run the script each time to check. [Extension Link](

## Git Setup

The linting rules have been set to follow [Airbnb javascript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
