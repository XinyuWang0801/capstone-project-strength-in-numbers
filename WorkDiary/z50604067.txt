Week 1:
Group formed. Created the github repository and added team members in as collaborators. We did a bit of research into what interesting features we can implement - looking at what other travel websites did well.
Wrote the background section for the proposal. 
Discussed possible epics with team, wrote out the ideas into the proposal.

Week 2:
Set up CI/CD pipeline - integrating travis ci with github pull requests so that builds get automatically checked and deployed when they have been merged. 
Set up linting (for consistent code practices), initialized the react framework for the project and created the folder structure for easier development. 

Week 3:
Created base structure for the accommodation form, separating each question into their individual sections so that they can be worked on separately. 
Started work on the first section of the form, i.e. providing name of property, number of guests and the type of accommodation it is. Also worked on the 
second section which defines the number of rooms in the property.

Week 4: 
No work done related to project.

Week 5-7: 
Worked on the landing page for the application, integrating a search function which returns results from the firebase db. Continuing on from that I integrated 
the subsequent page from landing page which shows the results of the search in the UI, also worked on the page which shows further information of a specific accommodation.
In particular this page shows photos of the accommodation, further descriptions and the ability to book as well. 
Did a bit more work on the accommodation form, allowing users to add photos of the accommodation, provide a price and to add further details if desired.
